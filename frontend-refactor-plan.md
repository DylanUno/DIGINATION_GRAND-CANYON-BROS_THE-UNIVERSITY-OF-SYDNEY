# Frontend Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the phased approach to refactoring the frontend based on the new design. Please follow these phases sequentially. For each phase, start a new chat session and provide the specified files.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

**Goal:** Establish the project's foundation, including dependencies, styling, and the root layout.

**AI Prompt for this phase:**
```
I'm refactoring my Next.js health analysis platform frontend with a new design system. This is Phase 1 of a 10-phase implementation plan where I need to establish the foundation - updating dependencies, configuring Tailwind CSS, setting up the root layout, and core utilities.

My current project structure is:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Three user roles: Patient, Health Worker, Specialist

I need you to help me implement the new foundation files. Please ask me to provide the files one by one in this specific order, and then integrate them into my existing project structure, adapting any paths or configurations to match my current setup.

The files I'll provide are configuration files, global styles, root layout, and utilities that form the foundation of the new design system.
```

**Files to provide in this chat:**

1.  `package.json` (for dependency updates)
2.  `tailwind.config.ts`
3.  `postcss.config.mjs`
4.  `next.config.mjs`
5.  `components.json`
6.  `tsconfig.json`
7.  `app/globals.css` OR `styles/globals.css` (whichever path you have)
8.  `app/layout.tsx`
9.  `lib/utils.ts`

## Phase 2: Core UI Components (Part 1 - Basic Components)

**Goal:** Implement the foundational UI components from shadcn/ui.

**AI Prompt for this phase:**
```
I'm continuing the refactoring of my Next.js health analysis platform frontend. This is Phase 2 of 10, where I need to implement the basic foundational UI components from the new design system.

I have a multi-role platform (Patient, Health Worker, Specialist) and need to establish the core shadcn/ui components that will be used throughout all portals. These are the fundamental building blocks like buttons, cards, inputs, and basic display components.

Please ask me to provide these foundational UI component files one by one, and help me integrate them into my existing project at `frontend/src/components/ui/`. Make sure all imports and exports are properly configured to work with the rest of my application.

I'll provide the theme provider and basic UI components that form the foundation of the design system.
```

**Files to provide in this chat:**

1.  `components/theme-provider.tsx`
2.  **Basic UI Components:**
    *   `components/ui/button.tsx`
    *   `components/ui/card.tsx`
    *   `components/ui/input.tsx`
    *   `components/ui/label.tsx`
    *   `components/ui/badge.tsx`

- Patient registration and biodata forms
- Health worker patient management forms  
- Navigation between different sections of each portal
- Mobile-responsive interactions

Please ask me to provide these form and navigation component files, and help me integrate them into my existing structure. Pay special attention to the hooks - I have both `hooks/` directory and `components/ui/` directory versions, so make sure they're placed correctly and work together.

These components will enable user interactions and navigation throughout the application.

## Phase 6: Authentication System & Schemas

**Goal:** Build the complete authentication flow, including layouts, forms, and validation schemas.

**AI Prompt for this phase:**
```
I'm implementing the authentication system for my health analysis platform. This is Phase 6 of 10, building the complete auth flow with role-based access.

My platform has three distinct user roles with different authentication needs:
- Patients: Self-registration with biodata collection
- Health Workers: Login only (registered by admin)

- Role-based dynamic login routing
- Multi-step patient registration (account creation â†’ biodata collection)
- Form components that integrate with the UI library we've built

Please ask me to provide these authentication files, and help me integrate them with my existing backend auth system. The schemas should work with react-hook-form, and the pages should use the UI components we've already implemented.
```

**Files to provide in this chat:**

1.  **Schemas:**
    *   `lib/schemas/patient-biodata-schema.ts`
    *   `lib/schemas/patient-registration-schema.ts`
